# Home Assistant Add-on

## Installation

Thanks to Home Assistant integration, NSPanel manager can be added very easily into your existing Home Assistant server.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with NSPanelManager pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNSPanelManager%2NSPManager)

### Recommended configuration
